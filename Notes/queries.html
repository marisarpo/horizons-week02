<p>The challenge: use media queries to change how these three elements are
  laid out as the screen size changes
</p>
<ul>
  <li>On large displays (>= 900px width), they should all be laid out in a
    row.</li>
  <li>On medium displays (>= 650px width), two should be on the first row,
    one below on its own line.</li>
  <li>On small displays (< 650px width), the three should stack.</li>
</ul>
<div class="elem first">First</div>
<div class="elem second">Second</div>
<div class="elem third">Third</div>

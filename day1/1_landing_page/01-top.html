            It's high time you stopped digging through emails and Slack messages
            to find that message from your housemate. Communicate, upload files, add
            due dates, and plot to #DominateAllTheHouses, all within a Horello
            board.

                This is a Horello board. It's a list of lists filled with cards,
                used by your house or by yourself.

                Drag and drop cards between lists to show progress. Add as many
                people as you need and drag them to cards. Add and reorder lists
                as you need. <strong>Horello adapts to your project, house, and
                workflow.</strong>

                You’ll see everything about your project just by glancing at the
                board, and it all updates in real-time. There’s nothing to set
                up and everyone gets it instantly.

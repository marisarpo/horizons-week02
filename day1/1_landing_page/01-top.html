            It's high time you stopped digging through emails and Slack messages
            to find that message from your housemate. Communicate, upload files, add
            due dates, and plot to #DominateAllTheHouses, all within a Horello
            board.

            This is a Horello board. It's a list of lists filled with cards,
            used by your house or by yourself.

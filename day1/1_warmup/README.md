# Warmup exercise: basic HTML

## Time limit: 15 minutes

## Instructions

Create a new document in your text editor. Save it as `intro.html`, and
open it in your web browser so that you can see your work.  Create a
basic web page introducing yourself. Use the following HTML tags:

- `html`, `head` - These are required
- `title` - Set your name as the page title
- `body` - Also required
- `h1` (header text) - Put your name in an `h1` tag at the top of the page
- `p` (paragraph text) - Write one paragraph introducing yourself
- `ul`, `li` (unordered list) - List three or four hobbies
- `a` (anchor) - Add a link to your Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram or
  other social media page
- Bonus: `img` (image) - add an image of yourself
- Bonus: Try centering the text and the image

If you're stuck, try looking at the source code for another page in your
browser. You can hit ⌥⌘U in Chrome to do this. You could also try
Googling "HTML template."

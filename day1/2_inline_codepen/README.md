## Time limit: 10 minutes

## Instructions

Navigate to http://codepen.io in your browser. Click "+New Pen" at the
top right. For now, click the "X" to close the CSS and JS panes.

Open the file [kittyland.html] in your web browser. Your goal is to
recreate this page precisely using the codepen. Note that with codepen
you can leave out the `head`, `body` etc. tags and skip right to the
content.

You can try doing things in this order:

- Try the various header tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) to see what they
  produce
- Add a link to another webpage
- Add an image
- Turn the image into a link
- Create the form

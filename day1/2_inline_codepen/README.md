# Inline exercise: Codepen

## Time limit: 10 minutes

## Instructions

Navigate to http://codepen.io in your browser. Click "+New Pen" at the
top right. For now, click the "X" to close the CSS and JS panes.

Take a look at Kittyland ([image][png], and the [live version][kittyland]). Your goal is to recreate this page precisely
using the codepen. Note that with codepen you can leave out the
`html`, `head`, `body` etc. tags and skip right to the content.

(Yes, this page looks pretty basic. This is what HTML looks like
without CSS, which you're about to learn!)

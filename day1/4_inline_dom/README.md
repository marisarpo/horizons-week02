# Inline exercise: DOM

## Time limit: 10 minutes

## Instructions

Open the [Trello homepage](http://www.trello.com) in your web browser
(if you're already logged into Trello and don't see the landing page, do
this in an incognito window instead so you won't be logged in). Use the
Chrome Developer Tools to add a new colored panel to the page, in
between the first and second sections.  Add an image and some text to
this section.

**Caution: if you reload the page, your changes will be lost! Make sure
not to reload.**

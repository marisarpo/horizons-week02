                It's high time you stopped digging through emails and Slack
                to find that message from your housemate. Communicate, upload files,
                add due dates, and plot to #DominateAllTheHouses, all within a
                Horello board.

                Horello will never overwhelm you with features you won’t use. For
                those who want more out of their boards, there are Power-Ups like
                calendar, card aging, and voting, that you can turn on. It’s a way
                to offer more without cluttering things for everyone.

# Bootstrap and responsive

As discussed in class, responsive web design is extremely important
due to the proliferation of web-enabled devices of all shapes and
sizes, from tiny phone screens up to massive monitors and everything
in betwee. Did you know that 65% of Facebook traffic already comes
from mobile devices, and that more than half of Facebook's users have
_never used the site on anything but mobile?_ It's important that all
modern web pages and applications be built for a range of viewing sizes.

One of the easiest ways to build responsive web pages which work
across a wide range of device sizes is with the modern Bootstrap
framework. Bootstrap is primarily a library of intelligent CSS styles
that auto-adjust your content, moving things around to fit the screen
size. However, Bootstrap also contains a set of powerful components
including buttons, icons, bars, etc., and some Javascript to tie it
all together. In this exercise, you'll be using Bootstrap's
responsive features.

You're going to expand on the Horello landing page you built yesterday
by adding some responsive elements to make the page function better on a
small screen.

## A few important details

- You'll be working in the `skeleton` directory. Each phase of the
project is contained in HTML and CSS files prefixed with the phase
number, e.g., `1_top.html`.
- Study the mockup screenshots closely. Use an app like Preview in OS X
so that you can easily pan, zoom, and measure things.
- Get very comfortable using Chrome's Developer Tools (⌥⌘I, or View >
Developer > Developer Tools).
- The best way to do web development is to make small, incremental
changes to the HTML and CSS and then reload in the browser to see the
changes. When you get comfortable using the power Developer Tools,
you'll see how to test individual changes in real time without
changing your code.
- Keep the [specs] handy as you'll need them throughout this project.

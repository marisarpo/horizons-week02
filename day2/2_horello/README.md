# Horello: building your first web app

Believe it or not, by this point you've seen all of the fundamental
building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS, Javascript, the Chrome
Developer Tools, and third party libraries. You've got all of the
tools you need to begin building a real web application. You're
probably very used to running applications on your mobile phone and
on your desktop. A web app is exactly the same, except that it's
written using this stack of web technologies and runs in your web
browser. You're probably very familiar with web apps such as Gmail.

Today we're going to begin building the Horello web app. Over the
next few days, we'll add more sophisticated features such as data
structures and objects, reading and writing that data over the
network, and authentication. Today we'll start by laying out the look
and feel of the application.

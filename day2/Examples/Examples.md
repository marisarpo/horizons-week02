- Before you jump in
- Keep [lesson slides](http://lessons.horizonsbootcamp.com/lessons/week02/day2.html)
  open in your browser. Lesson slides contain code samples and links to
  essential documentation.
- You can write all your solutions in the same project. You don't need to
  create a new React Native project for each secion.
- Ask for help early and often! ðŸ™‹

## Section 1: [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

### [Watch me](https://vimeo.com/208401683)

Open [http://codepen.io/moose-horizons/pen/YNQjvq](http://codepen.io/moose-horizons/pen/YNQjvq) and
use media queries so that the three elements are laid out responsively as per the instructions.

Check out the [live, working version][live].

Tips:
- Fill in the empty media queries in the CSS section.
- You can achieve this entirely using CSS and media queries, you don't
  need to modify the HTML.
- Make changes in Dev Tools first to see what works! You can make your
  browser window wider or smaller to view the page with different screen
  sizes.

1. Change your code in the above codepen for the `.item1` CSS class to make it 5 times as large as `item2`. It should look like:

    ![flex-ratio]

### [Watch me: Centering](https://vimeo.com/208572816)

## Section 3: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/)

### [Watch me: Bootstrap Installation & Grid](https://vimeo.com/208747027)

Work in the `/week02/day2/Examples/bootstrap_form/index.html` file.

__Note:__ Make sure that your _Date of Birth_ field is a date picker, and that your state picker is a dropdown.

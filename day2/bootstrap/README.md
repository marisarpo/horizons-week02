# Inline exercise: Bootstrap

## Time limit: 10 minutes
## Instructions

We're going to revisit the codepen from the warmup exercise. Your
challenge is to do the same thing using Bootstrap. To recap:

- On large displays (>= 900px width), the elements should all be laid
  out in a row.
- On medium displays (>= 650px width), two should be on the first row,
  one below on its own line.
- On small displays (< 650px width), the three should stack.

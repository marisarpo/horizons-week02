  open in your browser. Lesson slides contain code samples and links to
  essential documentation.
- You can write all your solutions in the same project. You don't need to
  create a new React Native project for each secion.
- Ask for help early and often! ðŸ™‹

## Section 1: [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

### [Watch me](https://vimeo.com/208401683)

Open [http://codepen.io/moose-horizons/pen/YNQjvq](http://codepen.io/moose-horizons/pen/YNQjvq) and
use media queries so that the three elements are laid out responsively as per the instructions.

Check out the [live, working version][live].

Tips:
- Fill in the empty media queries in the CSS section.
- You can achieve this entirely using CSS and media queries, you don't
  need to modify the HTML.
- Make changes in Dev Tools first to see what works! You can make your
  browser window wider or smaller to view the page with different screen
  sizes.

    Codepen: [http://codepen.io/prath/pen/aJrGgx](http://codepen.io/prath/pen/aJrGgx)

    ![flex-sizing]

1. Change your code in the above codepen for the `.item1` CSS class to make it 5 times as large as `item2`. It should look like:

    ![flex-ratio]

### [Watch me: Centering](https://vimeo.com/208572816)

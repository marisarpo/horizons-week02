## Before you start: `git pull`

We've updated some of the files in this exercise. For these exercises to work,
you'll need to first update to the latest version, using `git`:

```sh
git commit -am 'day1-3 work' # this saves all your current work (if you have not yet)
git pull # this downloads the changes we made
git merge origin/master -m merge # this updates your current branch to have the changes we made
```

If you have any trouble, please talk to a TA and we can help you!

### [Watch me: Intro. to AJAX](https://vimeo.com/210894693)

1. __Poetry Slam:__ In this example you will `GET` a poem from
   [https://horizons-school-of-technology.github.io/week02/day4/examples/poem.txt](https://horizons-school-of-technology.github.io/week02/day4/examples/poem.txt).
   Then you are to calculate the number of words it contains, and add that
   number to the element where `id="count"`.

    - Files to work on:
        - `/week02/day4/examples/ajax/poetry_slam/index.html`: Open this in your favourite web browser to read the instructions and test your solution.
        - `/week02/day4/examples/ajax/poetry_slam/js/index.js`: This is where you will make an AJAX request.

1. __Population:__ GET data from
   [https://horizons-school-of-technology.github.io/week02/day4/examples/data.json](https://horizons-school-of-technology.github.io/week02/day4/examples/data.json)
   and find the city with the highest population. Put that name in the `<h1>`
   tag with id `out`.

    - File to work on:
        - `/week02/day4/examples/ajax/population.html`: Write your JS/jQuery code in the `<script>` tag at the bottom of this file. Open it in your favourite web browser to test your solution.

### [Watch me: AJAX Error Handling](https://vimeo.com/210897988)

1. __List of Links:__ You will be given a list of links where some of them are broken. Your job is to perform `GET` requests to all of them, and remove the ones that do not work.

    - File to work on:
        - `/week02/day4/examples/errors.html`: Open this in your favourite web browser & text editor. Write your code in the `<script>` tags at the bottom of the `HTML` file.

### [Watch me: AJAX is Asynchronous](https://vimeo.com/210971431)

1. __AJAX Async:__ in this exercise, we'll use the JSON returned to us from one ajax request to make more ajax requests to new URLs.

   - File to work on:
       - `/week02/day4/examples/async.html`: Open this in your favourite web browser & text editor. Write your code in the `<script>` tag at the bottom of the `HTML` file.

   1. GET data from
   [https://horizons-school-of-technology.github.io/week02/day4/examples/products.json](https://horizons-school-of-technology.github.io/week02/day4/examples/products.json)

      * This data should be an array of objects, each having a 'url' property

   1. For each of the URLs from the previous step, make a GET request to load
      that product's data.

      * Each product url should return json of the form:

        ```json
        {
          "id": "Ke8jdu4JKJ964Htr6J90Hf3mW9JkjJ33",
          "name": "Large Bubble Tea Drink",
          "priceCents": 500
        }
        ```

   1. Once you have all of the product data, sort the products in order of
      their price, from lowest to highest.

   1. Replace the contents of the div with id "products" with a list of the
      products and their prices (sorted from lowest price to highest price)

      <blockquote><details><summary>
      Hint
      </summary>

      You'll want to put them in a list, so you'll need a `ul` or `ol` element,
      and some `li` list items inside.

      </details></blockquote>

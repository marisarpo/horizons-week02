# Horello pt. 2

Now that you've built our a simple data model for Horello that responds to inputs and events, you're going to be hooking up your Horello application to the Trello API and make it truly persistent.

## Phase 1: Get Trello Credentials

Before you begin, please log in to your Trello account. If you do not, create a Trello account by heading over to [Trello](https://trello.com/) and clicking `Sign Up`. 

Once you've logged into your Trello account:
1. Navigate to the [Trello Docs](https://developers.trello.com/get-started/start-building)
2. Click the `Get your Application Key` button.
3. Copy down your API Key to `config.js`
4. Generate a token manually by clicking on the `Token` link on that page.
5. Copy down that Authentication token to `config.js` int the place provided for you.

Once you've finished getting your Trello credentials, continue onto Phase 2 to link your Horello UI to Trello.

## Phase 2: Post your first note

## Phase 3: Post cards
